# Improvements and limits to my project

## Improvements
Third graph:
- Some circles are not completely drawn out in 
- It would be useful to find a more aesthetic solution for where to place the key so that is it neither too close to the graph nor too far away.
- Axes that do not start at zero is not the best solution but this was done to prevent the data from being squashed onto one side.
- Perhaps there are too many variables shown at once which may confuse the user.
- The interactive side could be improved e.g., Instead of having Portugal total, use the cities to give the user choice of city or year.

## Limits
- Emigration alone cannot be considered as the reason behind the loss of population.
- Would be useful to have a wider data range on immigration to consider immigration in the last graph as well.
